This guide replaces an earlier one originally prepared by Cambridge University Press (CUP) in 1994, and last updated in 2002 by Blackwell Publishing.
Some code segments are reproduced from, and some examples are based upon, that guide.
The authors were: A.~Woollatt, M.~Reed, R.~Mulvey, K.~Matthews, D.~Starling, Y.~Yu, A.~Richardson (all CUP), and Penny~Smith, N.~Thompson and Gregor~Hutton (all Blackwell), whose work is gratefully acknowledged.

The accompanying \bibtex\ style file was written by John Sleath, Tim Jenness and Norman Gray, without whom \bibtex\ support would not have been possible.

Some special symbols in tables~\ref{tab:anysymbols}--\ref{tab:mathssymbols} were taken from the Springer Verlag \textit{Astronomy \& Astrophysics} \LaTeX\ class, with their permission.

KTS thanks Nelson Beebe (University of Utah) for helpful advice regarding CTAN.
